# Music_Information_Retrieval_ML

Implemented Lyrics classifier using Naive Bayes Classifier and Support Vector Machines.
Gained experience with scikit learn for cross validation, K nearest neighbours and decision trees

Implemented Genre classification and compared three different algorithms for preprocessing (MFCC, CQT and half octave energies)
Got insights into block processing for audio files. Compared three machine learning algorithms (SVM, Naive Bayes and Logistic
Regression) for accuracy. The dataset used was GTZAN (10 genres). Got conversant with pandas dataframes 

Familiarized with regression models for emotion regression.

Implemented auto-tagging using OneVsRest Classifier for multi-label classification. Implemented query by text.
Computed the confusion matrix and calculated the accuracy using Precision, recall and F1 score. Compared the 
results with musicnn, the state of the art deep learning framework for auto tagging

Learnt about different dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, t-SNE) for visualization and inference
